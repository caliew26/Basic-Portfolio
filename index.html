            <p>Howdy Y'all, my name is Cali and I'm a leo, I like long walks on the beach and **change this to a link**Coco-Cola (just had to put that, this started off sounding like a dating portfolio, hahahaha). Seriously though, I'm Cali and I was born in Washington State many many many moons ago, have amazing parents and a few okay siblings.</p>
            <p>I love to smile and laugh, if thats something someone says about me when I'm not there, I'm very happy with that.  I want to spread joy and happyness to everyone I meet and everywhere I go.  </p>
            
            <h4>Family</h4>
            <p>I am (unfortunately) a widow; I met my late husband John 19 years ago on the internet in a chatroom on AOL (Yup, back when that was cool) and in May would be celebrating our 13th anniversary.  </p>
            <p>We had 2 "kids", Trip and Bear.  Trip will be 15 years old in May and is a jack russell; he loves long naps on his brothers bed and playing tug-o-war with his toy snake.  Bear would have been 13 this year, he was a lab/dingo mix; he was a lover, anyone who wanted to pet him was his best friend.  </p>
            <p>We all lived in Kentucky for the past 12 years (I recon I've picked up the "Howdy" and "y'all" from everyone there).  Trip and I only recently moved to Florida, I just love the sun!  I wanted to be in a "happy place" as I work through some of lifes challenges.  I absolutely LOVE ***make this a link***Disney and that "family" is such a strong theme with them, it's how I feel too. Have ya ever just went to one of the parks and just sat and watched; so many things to see and enjoy without even moving.  Only recently have I been told to bring my lunch and go to Tom Sawyer Park in Magic Kindgom and enjoy a picnic. What a wonderful idea!</p>
            
            <h4>Faith</h4>
            <p>Christ has a HUGE part in my life, I know that I put my trust in Him and because of that will enjoy eternal life in heaven; and I'll get to see my hubby again!</p>
            
            <h4>Activities</h4>
            <p>You can typically find me at a roller skating rink, listening to music and enjoying movies (at home and in theaters - love their popcorn!)!</p>
